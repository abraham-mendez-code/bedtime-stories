# Exercise — Bedtime Stories

In this exercise you will practice using a Scanner object to load and read a text
file in your java application.

### EXERCISE 2

Create a new Java application named **BedtimeStories**.

Unzip the <i>DataFiles.zip</i> file and copy the three children's stories to your
**BedtimeStories** project folder. <i>(goldilocks.txt, hansel_and_gretel.txt
</i>and <i>mary_had_a_little_lamb.txt</i>).

Each story text file contains a children’s bedtime story.

For example:

**<u>Goldilocks.txt</u>**

    Goldilocks and the Three Bears
    Once upon a time a girl named Goldilocks lived in
    a house at the edge of the woods. In those days
    curls of hair were called "locks." She was
    "Goldilocks" because golden hair ran down her head
    and shoulders.

Prompt the user for the name of the story/file to read.

Use a new <i>BufferedReader</i> to load and read each line of the selected story in
the file. Print the file to the screen, but add a line number to the beginning of
each line

#### <u>Example</u>

    Enter the name of a story: goldilocks.txt
